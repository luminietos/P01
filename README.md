![todo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77718358/232029094-1da121e4-7760-40c2-b5d7-4502385c1159.jpg)

## Description
This is a simple online To-Do list I made as my first JavaScript project for my University's introductory JS course, created in March 2022.

You can find the website [here](https://luminietos.github.io/P01/) (GitHub) or [here](https://admirable-bavarois-7adc9c.netlify.app/) (Netlify).

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
Write an item on the to-do list, and click the "+" -button (or by using the ENTER key on your keyboard) to add it to the list. Refreshing or closing and re-opening the page will not get rid of it.

Once you've added one or more items, you can filter them based on whether you've marked them as completed or not. The default view shows all items on the list.
Clicking the green checkmark button will mark the item you selected as completed. Clicking the red skull button will delete it, meaning it will not show up, even once you refresh the page - it is deleted from the list for good.

The above is an example of what the "completed" view looks like in use.

The list itself adapts and grows as you add more items.
